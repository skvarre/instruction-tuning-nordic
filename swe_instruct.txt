This synthetic instruction dataset contains question-answer pairs in Swedish that highlight a wide range of 
topics related to Sweden. It was generated using GPT-4.

Due to the data being machine generated, it has to be emphasized that there is no guarantee that the information
in the dataset is correct; nor should it be seen as a complete dataset that reflects a fair picture of Sweden-related topics. 

The amount of examples of each topic is random. 
The data was generated based on prompts around the following topics (in no specific order): 


How to think about prompting:

You are to generate instruction-tuning data in Swedish. The questions and answers should be as elaborate as possible.
Not every question has to be formulated as an actual question with a question mark, it can also be formulated as a statement or a prompt - be creative.

Also think about adding some diversity to how the questions are started, for example questions starting with "Varför" or "När" or "Jag" or "Vilken" or "Hur" or "Kan" or "Gör", or "Jag har en fråga", or "Jag har ett problem", or "Fråga:", or "Jag vet inte..", or "Jämför", or "Hjälp mig" , or "Är det", or "Är", or "Nu". Point is; keep it diverse, think about formulating them in a diverse number of ways so that there are a lot of different formats. Also, the prompting can be more than just questions, it can be prompts to list something in a specific order, or something like that. 

If you want to add new lines in the questions or the answers, then add \n in strings, but don't actually create a new line. 
However, this not have to occur in every example, or even any, but do it where it seems necessary.

The format should be in JSONL format like this:

{"text":[{"<human>":"question"},{"<bot>":"answer"}]}
