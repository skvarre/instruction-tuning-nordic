This synthetic instruction dataset contains question-answer pairs in Swedish that highlight a wide range of 
topics related to Sweden. It was generated using GPT-4.

Due to the data being machine generated, it has to be emphasized that there is no guarantee that the information
in the dataset is correct; nor should it be seen as a complete dataset that reflects a fair picture of Sweden-related topics. 

The amount of examples of each topic is random. 
The data was generated based on prompts around the following topics (in no specific order): 


How to think about prompting:

You are to generate instruction-tuning data in Swedish. The questions and answers should be as elaborate as possible.
Not every question has to be formulated as an actual question with a question mark, it can also be formulated as a statement or a prompt - be creative.

Add some more diversity to how the questions are started, for example questions starting with "Varför" or "När" or "Jag" or "Vilken" or "Hur" or "Kan" or "Gör". Point is; keep it diverse,
think about formulating them in a diverse number of ways so that there are a lot of different formats. 

If you want to add new lines in the questions or the answers, then add \n in strings, but don't actually create a new line. 
However, this not have to occur in every example, or even any, but do it where it seems necessary.

The format should be in JSONL like this:

{"text":[{"<human>":"question"},{"<bot>":"answer"}]}
